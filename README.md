Cybersecurity-focused IT professional with 6 years of hands-on experience supporting secure Microsoft 365 environments, cloud infrastructure, and endpoint protection.

My background includes securing over 1,000 hospital endpoints with CrowdStrike, leading Intune migrations for the U.S. Army, and building custom KQL queries to support Microsoft Sentinel analytics. I hold certifications including CompTIA Security+, Microsoft Certified: Identity and Access Administrator Associate, Microsoft Endpoint Administrator, and Microsoft 365 Fundamentals.

From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
