# Nate Spencer's Profile

Cybersecurity-focused IT professional with 6 years of hands-on experience supporting secure Microsoft 365 environments, cloud infrastructure, and endpoint protection. I’ve worked across healthcare, government, and enterprise sectors, deploying tools like Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, Intune, and Azure to enhance threat detection, incident response, and compliance. My background includes securing over 1,000 hospital endpoints with CrowdStrike, leading Intune migrations for the U.S. Army, and building custom KQL queries to support Microsoft Sentinel analytics. I hold certifications including CompTIA Security+, Microsoft Certified: Identity and Access Administrator Associate, Microsoft Endpoint Administrator, and Microsoft 365 Fundamentals.

With a Bachelor of Science in Aviation Management from Utah Valley University, I’m combining my passion for aviation and cybersecurity to shape my career toward protecting aviation systems from cyber threats. I am forward-thinking and currently preparing to pursue a Master’s in Aviation Cybersecurity at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, aiming to bridge the gap between IT security and critical infrastructure protection in aviation environments.
